The Nand2tetris course is based on "Building a Modern Computer from First Principles".
It was the best course that I`ve ever watch.
Myself akshat, is the student of that course and working on the project they gave.
Nand2tetris offer various project in each week as a assignment.
So the work which was done by me has been stored in github to present what I learn from this course.
